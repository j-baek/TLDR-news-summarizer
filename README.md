# TLDR-news-summarizer
for people who are too lazy to read entire news but want to get some information
<br />
<br />

## Purpose
<br />
to give users news summarized in a few sentences.

## Inspiration
<br />
I always felt a bit lazy to read the whole news, and wanted shorter news just for important information.
<br />
Then, I thought I could write a program to interact with chatGPT to get summarization of news.

## Simple explanation
This program scrapes news from a certain website (tbd) using Python and Beautiful Soup.
<br />
Then it uses OpenAI API to give scraped news to chatGPT to summarize the news in a few sentences (number of sentences can be defined by the user)
<br />

## Steps

## notes
New York Times offers API so maybe I can use New York Times...
