        "summary": "Tens of thousands of teachers in South Korea have been protesting for more protection from students and parents, following the suicide of a first-grade teacher who was found dead in her classroom. The teachers point to a 2014 child abuse law, which they say makes them fearful of disciplining students for fear of being sued by parents. The government has passed legal revisions to protect teachers from being sued for child abuse and to shift the responsibility for handling complaints and lawsuits from teachers to principals."
