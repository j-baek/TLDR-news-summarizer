        "summary": "Tens of thousands of teachers in South Korea have been protesting for more protection from students and parents, following the suicide of a first-grade teacher who was found dead in her classroom. The teachers point to a 2014 child abuse law, which they say makes them fearful of disciplining students for fear of being sued by parents. The government has passed legal revisions to protect teachers from being sued for child abuse and to shift the responsibility for handling complaints and lawsuits from teachers to principals."

Examples include San Geronimo and Ocean Meadows in California, Rancho Ca\u00f1ada in Monterey, and Valley View Golf Course in Ohio. Similar initiatives are also taking place in the UK and Australia."

Musk's leadership saw a significant reduction in workforce, policy and product overhauls that altered content moderation, a decline in ad revenue, and his erratic behavior and influence overshadowing the platform. While Musk's vision for Twitter's future as an \"everything app\" is pushed forward by new CEO Linda Yaccarino, the platform's path to recovery remains uncertain amid legal challenges and regulatory investigations."

While reaching this target is not guaranteed, experts believe that as EV technology improves, prices drop, and more models become available, consumer demand for EVs will increase, making it more likely to achieve the two-thirds market share goal in the coming years."
